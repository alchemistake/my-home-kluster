# My Home Kuberenete ~Cluster~ Server
This is a weird collection of YAML files and Shell Scripts. Use it if you like, but beware that I'm not responsible in anyway due to setup changes. I'm trying to run kuberenetes at home because it is easier to manage than a bare metal server. If you want to know why I run these, please open an Issue.
